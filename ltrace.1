.SH NAME
ltrace \- A library call tracer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ltrace
.I "[-difLS] [-a column] [-s strsize] [-o filename] [-u username] [-p pid] ... [command [arg ...]]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ltrace
is a program that simply runs the specified
.I command
until it exits.  It intercepts and records the dynamic library calls
which are called by the executed process and the signals which are
received by that process.
.PP
Its use is very similar to
.BR strace(1).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-d
Increase the debugging level.
.TP
.I \-i
Print the instruction pointer at the time of the library call.
.TP
.I \-f
Trace child processes as they are created by
currently  traced processes as a result of the fork(2)
or clone(2) system calls.
The new process is attached as soon as its pid is known.
.TP
.I \-L

Display system calls as well as library calls
.TP
