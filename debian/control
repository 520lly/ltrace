Description: A library call tracer
 ltrace is a library call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
 a trace of all the dynamic library calls made by another process/program.
 .
 It also displays system calls, as well as `strace', but strace still
 does a better job displaying arguments to system calls.
 .
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have the source handy.
 .
 This is still a work in progress, so some things may fail or don't work
 as expected.
