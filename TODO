* {enable,disable}_all_breakpoints should be process-dependent

* All wait4's should be wait_for_child():
  + A process may stop because:
    - It execve()'d (needs breakpoints to be added) (DONE)
    - It received a signal                          (DONE)
    - It breakpointed at a library call             (DONE)
    - It breakpointed at a library return
    - It breakpointed at a syscall
    - It breakpointed at a syscall return
    - It breakpointed after a SINGLESTEP

* ``struct_process'' should also have:
  + The state of the process:
    - uninitialized               (DONE)
    - running
    - within a given library call
    - within a given syscall      (DONE)
  + All the symbols it has breakpointed, and, for each of them:
    - its addr
    - the original value in the addr, if appropiate
  + Whether a return from a libcall is pending, and if so:
    - its return addr
    - the original value in the return addr

* I should parse a config file (/etc/ltrace.conf & ~/.ltracerc) to
  handle different arguments to the library calls

* ltrace should accept `-p' option. (hey, it's not as difficult as it
  seems)

* return values should be logged.  That implies:
  + Breakpointing each return value
  + Disabling breakpoints and displaying ``???'' as return value when
    a new function is called

* All architecture dependent stuff should be moved to ``arch.h''
